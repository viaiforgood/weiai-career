 * Sends a message to a Web Worker and returns a Promise that resolves with
 * the worker's response, or rejects if the worker replies with an error.
 *
 * Uses a {@link MessageChannel} so each call gets its own private reply port,
 * making concurrent calls safe without shared state.
 *
 * @param message - The typed message to send (`refresh` or `revoke`).
 * @param to      - The target {@link Worker} instance.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves with the worker's response payload.
